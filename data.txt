A: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

10. Q: What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
A: An array has a fixed size and is stored contiguously, while a linked list has a variable size and uses pointers to link nodes.

11. Q: Define stack overflow.
A: Stack overflow occurs when too much memory is used on the call stack, typically due to deep or infinite recursion.

14. Q: What is dynamic programming?
A: Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each only once.

15. Q: Explain the term ‘graph’ in DSA.
A: A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges.

16. Q: Define depth-first search (DFS).
A: DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph structures by exploring as far along each branch as possible before backtracking.

17. Q: What is breadth-first search (BFS)?
A: BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph structures by visiting all the nodes at the current depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level.

A: A heap is a special tree-based structure in which the parent node is either greater than (max-heap) or less than (min-heap) the child nodes.

19. Q: Explain the term ‘sorting algorithm.’
A: Sorting algorithms are techniques used to arrange elements of a list or array in a certain order, such as ascending or descending.

A: A circular queue is a linear data structure that connects the end of the queue back to the front, forming a circle.

21. Q: Define merge sort.
A: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.

22. Q: What is a doubly linked list?
A: A doubly linked list is a linked list where each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one to the previous node.

23. Q: Explain hashing in DSA.
A: Hashing is the process of mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, commonly used in hash tables.

24. Q: What is the time complexity of binary search?
A: The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).

A: Tree traversal is the process of visiting all nodes in a tree data structure in a specific order.

26. Q: What is selection sort?
A: Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it in the sorted portion.

27. Q: Describe an AVL tree.
A: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for any node.

28. Q: What is a priority queue?
A: A priority queue is a type of queue where each element is associated with a priority and elements are served based on their priority.

29. Q: Explain insertion sort.
A: Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element in its proper place.

30. Q: What is graph traversal?
A: Graph traversal is the process of visiting all nodes in a graph systematically.

31. Q: What are binary search trees (BST)?
A: A BST is a binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node.

32. Q: Explain memoization in dynamic programming.
A: Memoization is a technique in dynamic programming where results of expensive function calls are stored and reused.

33. Q: What is an adjacency matrix?
A: An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a graph, where elements indicate if pairs of vertices are adjacent.

34. Q: Define backtracking.
A: Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds solutions and abandons them if they are found to be invalid.

35. Q: Describe Kruskal's algorithm.
A: Kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by adding edges in order of increasing weight.

36. Q: What is Floyd-Warshall algorithm?
A: Floyd-Warshall is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

37. Q: Define the knapsack problem.
A: The knapsack problem is an optimization problem where items with weights and values are selected to maximize value without exceeding weight capacity.

38. Q: Explain depth of a tree.
A: Depth of a tree is the number of edges from the tree's root node to the farthest leaf node.

A: A trie is a tree-like data structure used for storing dynamic sets of strings, typically for efficient string searching.

A: Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, detects cycles in a sequence of nodes.

41. Q: What is linear probing?
A: Linear probing is a collision resolution method in hash tables, where the next slot is checked linearly until an empty slot is found.

42. Q: Define spanning tree.
A: A spanning tree is a subset of a graph that includes all vertices with the minimum possible number of edges.

43. Q: What is divide and conquer?
A: Divide and conquer is a paradigm that divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each recursively, and combines results.

44. Q: Explain a max heap.
A: A max heap is a binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
